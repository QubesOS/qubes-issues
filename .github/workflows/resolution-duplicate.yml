            This issue has been closed as a "duplicate." This means that another issue exists that is very similar to or subsumes this one. If any useful information on this issue is not already present on the other issue, please add it in a comment on the other issue. Here are some common cases of duplicate issues:

            - The other issue is closed. The other issue being closed does not prevent this issue from duplicating it. We will examine the closed issue and, if appropriate, reopen it.
            - The other issue is for a different Qubes release. We usually maintain only one issue for all affected Qubes releases.
            - The other issue is very old. The mere age of an issue is not, by itself, a relevant factor when determining duplicates.

            By default, the newer issue will be closed in favor of the older issue. However, we make exceptions when we determine that it would be significantly more useful to keep the newer issue open instead of the older one.

            We respect the time and effort you have taken to file this issue, and we understand that this outcome may be unsatisfying. Please accept our sincere apologies and know that we greatly value your participation and membership in the Qubes community.

            If anyone reading this believes that this issue was closed in error or that the resolution of "duplicate" is not accurate, please leave a comment below saying so, and we will review this issue again.
